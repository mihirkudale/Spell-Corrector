# Spell-Corrector-NLP-Project

**PROBLEM STAEMENT**

In this project we will be using deep learning approaches to build a spelling corrector.

**DESCRIPTION OVERVIEW**

A word needs to be checked for spelling correctness and corrected if necessary, many a time in the context of the surrounding words. A spellchecker points to spelling errors and possibly suggests alternatives. An autocorrector usually goes a step further and automatically picks the most likely word. In case of the correct word already having been typed, the same is retained
